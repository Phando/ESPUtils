# ESPUtils
A library to make managing ESP32 devices easy. Includes LoRa, BLE, OTA and general Utilities.

# Partition Tables
An ESP32â€™s flash can contain multiple apps, as well as many different kinds of data (calibration data, filesystems, parameter storage, etc). How much memory is devoted to which use is configuraable through the use of partition tables. 

A set of alternative partition tables as well as additional infomration can be found in the [ESPUtils/partitions/Reademe.md](partitions/README.md).
